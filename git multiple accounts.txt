Use HTTPS:

change remote url to https:

git remote set-url origin https://USERNAME@github.com/USERNAME/PROJECTNAME.git
and you are good to go:

git push
To ensure that the commits appear as performed by USERNAME, one can setup the user.name and user.email for this project, too:

git config user.name USERNAME
git config user.email USERNAME@example.com
